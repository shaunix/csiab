# User Stories

> Let's start writing user stories. User help you decide what
> you need to write and who you're writing it for. Think about
> your personas. Then think about the things they want to do.
> Start writing user stories in the form:
>
> * As a PERSONA, I want to TASK so I can GOAL.
>
> For example:
>
> * As a Sith Lord, I want to destroy the Jedi so I can
>   rule the galaxy.
>
> A task is a concrete thing a user can do. It should fairly
> small. Goals are bigger picture. In general, you will usually
> write docs for tasks, but understanding the goals they enable
> can help you write better docs.
>
> This is a fun exercise to do collaboratively. Especially if
> you have multiple contributors in a room, you can write user
> stories on a whiteboard or on sticky notes. Often, hearing
> user stories will prompt people to think of more.
