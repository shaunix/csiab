# Technical Considerations

> Every documentation project has constraints. These could be
> technical constraints imposed by the parent software project,
> or constraints due to the composition of the community.
> Understanding these constraints will inform what you write,
> and will affect your technical decisions.

* We expect to have roughtly N topics of content.

* The content needs to be translated into N languages.
  - Are any of those languages RTL?

* We expect to have roughly N regular contributors.

* Difficulty of becoming a contributor
  - Difficulty due to process overhead
  - Difficulty due to complexity of software documented

* Frequency of drive-by contributors

* Contributors will come from *COMPANIES* *and volunteers?*

* *PROJECT* is released every N months.
  - Is it important to publish old versions of documentation?

* The release cycle provides N weeks for documentation work.
