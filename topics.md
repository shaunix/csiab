# Topics

> Now we'll start planning topics. These are the actual things
> you'll write in your documentation. There are different kinds
> of topics. Most people recognize three main types: task,
> concept, and reference.
>
> * A task is a concrete thing the user can do. These will come
>   directly from your user stories.
> * A concept is something the user might need to understand to
>   perform certain tasks. Sometimes these are phrased as
>   questions, such as "What is a Jedi?"
> * A reference topic is used to quickly look up something. This
>   is most frequently used for API references and configuration
>   key references.
>
> There are other types of topics as well, such as tutorials and
> troubleshooting topics. If you need them, feel free to branch
> out from the three core topic types.
>
> Start writing topics by listing tasks from your user stories.
> For each topic, list what personas it pertains to and what other
> topics the user needs to first understand or perform. Concepts
> will be informed by your tasks. As you work through tasks, try
> to think of what conceptual information a user might need to
> perform those tasks.
>
> Sometimes as you do this, you will think of more tasks. That's
> OK. Just go back and add them to your user stories, then list
> them here.
>
> Finally, your writers' time is limited, so you'll have to
> prioritize content. For each topic, record how important the
> topic is, as well as how difficult it will be to research and
> write well. It's best to list all your topics first, then do
> a second pass to figure out importance and difficulty.
