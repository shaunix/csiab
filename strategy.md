> This template provides an easy starting point for creating a
> documentation content strategy for your open source project.
> It does not try to address every need or solve every problem,
> but it does serve as a good starting point.

> Throughout this template, content in block quotes like this
> provides instructions to you. Once you understand what to do
> you can remove them. Content outside of block quotes serves
> as templates that you should fill out.

> Start by writing a quick synopsis of wht the project is,
> what components it contains, and what it helps people to
> do. This will help you identify objectives and goals.

*PROJECT* is a tool that does all the things. It consists of
a server that eats your CPU, a set of command line tools that
talk to the server, an API for writing your own tools, and
libraries in Python, Ruby, and Ada that implement the API.
